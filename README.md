# NumeralSystemConverter

This program was made when I was learning Python. It tries to adapt to screen sizes and avoid user input errors.

It converts between different numeral systems (2-16) with the possibility to use decimal numbers. It is flexible and you can just write down the number and use the arrow to convert directly.

Unfortunately, everything is in Lithuanian, so you will need to use a translator.

# Update

Now you can use both ways to convert numeral systems.
